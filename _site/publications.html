<p><strong><a href="pldi071-devito.pdf">Terra: A Multi-Stage Language for High-Performance Computing</a></strong> <br />
<em>Zachary DeVito, James Hegarty, Alex Aiken, Pat Hanrahan, and Jan Vitek</em><br />
PLDI ‘13</p>

<p>High-performance computing applications, such as auto-tuners and
domain-specific languages, rely on generative programming techniques to
achieve high performance and portability. However, these systems are often
implemented in multiple disparate languages and perform code generation in a
separate process from program execution, making certain optimizations
difficult to engineer. We leverage a popular scripting language, Lua, to
stage the execution of a novel low-level language, Terra. Users can
implement optimizations in the high-level language, and use built-in
constructs to generate and execute high-performance Terra code. To simplify
meta-programming, Lua and Terra share the same lexical environment, but, to
ensure performance, Terra code can execute independently of Lua’s
runtime. We evaluate our design by reimplementing existing multi-language
systems entirely in Terra. Our Terra-based auto-tuner for BLAS routines
performs within 20% of ATLAS, and our DSL for stencil computations runs
2.3x faster than hand-written C.</p>

<p><strong><a href="pldi083-devito.pdf">First-class Runtime Generation of High-performance Types using Exotypes</a></strong> <br />
<em>Zachary DeVito, Daniel Ritchie, Matt Fisher, Alex Aiken, and Pat Hanrahan</em><br />
To appear in PLDI ‘14</p>

<p>We introduce <em>exotypes</em>, user-defined types that combine the flexibility of meta-object protocols in dynamically-typed languages with the performance control of low-level languages. Like objects in dynamic languages, exotypes are defined programmatically at runtime, allowing behavior based on external data such as a database schema. To achieve high performance, we use staged programming to define the behavior of an exotype during a runtime compilation step and implement exotypes in Terra, a low-level staged programming language.</p>

<p>We show how exotype constructors compose, and use exotypes to implement high-performance libraries for serialization, dynamic assembly, automatic differentiation, and probabilistic programming. Each exotype achieves expressiveness similar to libraries written in dynamically-typed languages but implements optimizations that exceed the performance of existing libraries written in low-level statically-typed languages. Though each implementation is significantly shorter, our serialization library is 11 times faster than Kryo, and our dynamic assembler is 3–20 times faster than Google’s Chrome assembler.</p>
